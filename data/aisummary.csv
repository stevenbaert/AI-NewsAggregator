"There's big risk in not knowing what OpenAI is building in the cloud, warn Oxford scholars","**Summary:** 
A recent report by the University of Oxford and its collaborators warns of the potentially serious risks associated with the lack of transparency from OpenAI regarding its latest large language model (LLM), GPT-4. The paper delves into the emerging ""Language-Models-as-a-Service"" (LMaaS) industry and raises critical points about the accessibility, replicability, comparability, and trustworthiness of such services, which are often concealed behind commercial pressure and the inherent ""black-box"" nature.

  
**Takeaways:** 
- The report points out that the secretive approach taken by OpenAI, particularly about its GPT-4 model, presents a significant ethical concern as it restricts understanding, trust, and control over these models.
- Commercial pressure has led to the development of large, high-performance language models like GPT-4 that are available exclusively as a service for customers, without providing any detailed information on their architecture, implementation, or training procedure.
- The authors propose that companies should release the source code of their LMaaS programs to auditors or evaluators, even if not to the general public.
- They also suggest that companies should not completely discard older language models when they roll out new ones. They recommend the creation of a log of 'model commits' offered by model maintainers to users as the model is updated.
- According to the authors, tools need to be developed to test what elements an LMaaS has digested of its prompts, to set an accurate baseline.","The language-model-as-a-service industry is concealing critical details about reliability and trustworthiness, warns a report by the University of Oxford and its collaborators.",03-10-23,https://www.zdnet.com/article/theres-big-risk-in-not-knowing-what-openai-is-building-in-the-cloud-warn-oxford-scholars/,https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/459e31f9d5c1cfe4bd359bb4da368d544432e045/2023/10/02/ab4c507c-4da3-4863-bcd5-7ed909291ccd/gettyimages-1398656750.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,OpenAI
What the WGA’s Historic Contract Means for All Writers in the Fight Against Generative AI,"**Summary:** 

The Writers Guild of America (WGA) secured a historic contract that establishes guidelines on how artificial intelligence (AI) can be utilized in the writing profession. The contract offers significant protections for writers against the potential misuse of AI in their field.

- AI technology itself cannot be recognized as a writer under the MBA.
- Studios are mandated to inform writers if any material they provide has been generated, fully or partially, by AI.
- Writers are permitted to utilize AI software (with studio approval and within relevant company policy) when performing writing services under the MBA.
- This victory sets a precedent for labor organizing against the threat of generative AI in other creative sectors.","The funniest picket sign I saw during the Writers Guild of America’s 148-day long strike came on Pretty Little Liars day, way back in mid-June.

XA4C: eXplainable representation learning via Autoencoders revealing Critical genes,"**Summary:** 
Researchers have developed XA4C, a novel artificial intelligence tool that uses explainable representation learning to reveal critical genes. This system leverages an 'autoencoder' model to process gene expression data and identify genes that significantly contribute to learned representations, dubbed 'Critical Genes'. These genes are then used to conduct explainable analysis.

**Takeaways:**
- XA4C combines two main components: an optimized autoencoder to process gene expression data, and a method to quantify each gene's contribution.
- 'Critical genes' are defined as genes that contribute highly to learned representations. These genes are then prioritized for further study.
- The system was applied to cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, revealing sensible genes and pathways.
- The results show that 'Critical genes' bring a different perspective, capturing information not revealed by traditional analysis methods.
- 'Critical genes' have a higher enrichment in a comprehensive disease gene database compared to differentially expressed or hub genes, suggesting their potential in revealing unknown biology of diseases.","Author summary We propose a gene expression data analysis tool, XA4C, which builds an eXplainable Autoencoder to reveal Critical genes.
