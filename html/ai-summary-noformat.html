      <td>The Language Of AI: How Humans Communicate With LLMs</td>
      <td>**Summary:** \n\nThe article discusses the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the potential risks that they pose in the hands of bad actors. It also highlights how AI and LLMs are used to improve various sectors, including healthcare and industry.\n\n**Takeaways:**\n- LLMs like ChatGPT and BERT are being used in AI, which marks a significant technological revolution.\n- There are concerns about these LLMs being used by cybercriminals to develop malware and improve their attack strategies.\n- The communication between humans and LLMs has evolved to optimize the accuracy of responses from these systems.\n- There are strategic techniques like OODA loop and PDCA cycle used for rapid adaptation and long-term learning in AI.\n- The article suggests studying "prompt engineering" for those interested in this field to better understand how to output text, images, 3D assets, and more.</td>
      <td>In this fast-paced AI race, how people talk to LLMs has evolved to optimize the accuracy of the answers they get from these LLM systems.</td>
